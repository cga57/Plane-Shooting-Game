# Plane-Shooting-Game (Python)
Created a 2D modeled shoot and click game with three difficulty levels, point tracking, storage of a high score and some animation using distributed systems.  I designed the entire software architecture with the aid of the software development cycle. Created using Python via Codeskulptor graphics library
